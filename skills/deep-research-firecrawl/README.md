# deep-research-firecrawl

Firecrawl-first deep research skill derived from `199-biotechnologies/claude-deep-research-skill` and adapted for multi-mode depth control with cleaner progressive disclosure.

## What changed

- Replaced generic retrieval guidance with explicit Firecrawl MCP usage.
- Preserved selectable modes: `quick`, `standard`, `deep`, `ultradeep`.
- Simplified and tightened `SKILL.md` for maintainability.
- Kept extended details in `reference/methodology.md`.
